# riffpga pre-compiled firmware sample

This is a pre-compiled version of riffpga.  You can put an RP2040, like Pi Pico boards, into bootmode and drop this onto the RPI-RP2 drive.

It is built with the defaults from config_defaults/generic.h so, if you want to wire it up to an FPGA, follow the various _PIN_XYZ_ defines in there.
